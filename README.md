# Cyclist - Case Study 01

Case study made as a capstone project for the Google Data Analyst Certificate

# 1.0 Introduction

We are a data analyst on a bike-share company named Cyclist which is based in Chicago, IL. It was launched in 2016 and has since then grown exponentially. It has a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.  
The company has flexibility in its pricing plans with them being: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 

# 2.0 Scenario

The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

# 3.0 Objective - Business Problem

The goal is to help the marketing team design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that we need to answer the question: 
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

# 4.0 Data

The analysis was made using all rides made in 2019. There were a total of 3,818,004 trips made.

# 5.0 Data Handle

I was asked to analyze 12 months of data in order to come up with some insights.  
The data was obtained from the link: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html  
I used the files from 2019. Those are divided in quarters.

# 6.0 Used Tools

Since the file's size is too big to handle on Excel/Google Sheets, I ended up using SQL to analyze the Data.  
To concatenate the data and perform some data cleaning it was used PYTHON, specifically the PANDAS library.  
To share the insights generated on SQL the visualization tool used was TABLEAU
